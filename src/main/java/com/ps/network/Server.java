   * Establish a Socket Connection
   * To write a server application two sockets are needed.
   * A ServerSocket which waits for the client requests (when a client makes a new Socket())
   * A plain old Socket socket to use for communication with the client.
   * Communication
   * getOutputStream() method is used to send the output through the socket.
   * Close the Connection
   * After finishing,  it is important to close the connection by closing the socket as well as input/output streams.
